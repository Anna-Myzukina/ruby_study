<ul><h2>Ruby is:</h2></ul>

<li>High-level, meaning reading and writing Ruby is really easy—it looks a lot like regular English!</li>

<li>Object-oriented, meaning it allows users to manipulate data structures called objects in order to build and execute programs. We’ll learn more about objects later, but for now, all you need to know is everything in Ruby is an object.</li>

<li>Easy to use. Ruby was designed by Yukihiro Matsumoto (often just called “Matz”) in 1995. Matz set out to design a language that emphasized human needs over those of the computer, which is why Ruby is so easy to pick up.</li>

<ul><h2>There are three data types in Ruby that we’re interested in right now: </ul</h2>
  <li>-Numeric (any number), </li>
  <li>-Boolean (which can be true or false), and </li>
  <li>-String (words or phrases like "I'm learning Ruby!").</li>
